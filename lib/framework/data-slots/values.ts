 * not a `max(version)` scan per slug (D4).
 *
 * This is the mechanical engine only. The `fill_slot` / `get_state` **capabilities**
 * that call it — with PII redaction, sensitivity-driven masking, open-mode slug
 * minting, structured-output extraction, and per-grant exposure — are
 * `f-slot-capture` (feature 10). Access scoping (`canRead`) is `f-journey-state`.

 * head via `in: []`. At scale, a partial index `(userId, capturedAt) WHERE
